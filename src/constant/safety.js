  "The reports and other material listed here explore buoyancy design in kayaks used on the sea and open water along with the ability of the crew to control their craft after mishap. Much of this material pre-dates the internet and most have never been published in any other media and never collected together before. As kayaking on the sea becomes increasingly popular, this information is intended to increase awareness about the importance of buoyancy.  It also illustrates how basic design can be improved to increase the paddler's control. ";
